x change render working directory to output image directory. keep only one log.

x support general cameras, not just camera, aim, up combinations

x move materials into 'materials'
x add __init__.py as appropriate
x support batch / animated renders

x hookup verbose render setting

x remove dependence on UI to drive render parameters
x add support for persisting render settings

 x ao, direct, path, volpath, volpath_simple, and irrcache.

x add support for meta-integrator parameters
 x adaptive, irrcache

x add support for film parameters

x support animated parameters in batch mode
 x added MAYA_RELEASE_PYTHON_GIL = 1 to Maya.env

x expand support for predefined 'conductor' materials

 x homogeneous
 x heterogeneous

x Support all surface scattering models
x Support all subsurface scattering models
x Support combination of surface and medium scattering models

x make plugin ids consistent

x indent code to 4 space tabs

x replace all mel functions with automatically generated mel which immediately calls back into Python

fixes based to use:
x eliminate duplicate geometry export
x replace illegal characters in exported geometry file names
x fixed broken texture element creation
x made all geometry references use the full dag path name

x respect visibility of lights
x handle object visibility better, i.e. look at visibility of parents
x fixed dipole sigma A, S, T and Albedo export types
x made light irradiance values linear (rgb, instead of srgb)

x add support for crop coordinates (pulled from general render settings or render view selection rectangle)

allow dipole sss to be used in mixture and blended bsdfs

support render cancel
support batch render cancel
support interactive render view / update / cancel

create renderData/mitsuba directory for temporary render files

use pre-generated mip-maps if they exist

figure out if you can load multichannel exrs into the Maya Render View
add support for metadata and label annotations with ldrfilm and hdrfilm
standardize callbacks used in UI

organize UI
- connect activation of multichannel and metaintegrators to choice of base integrator

add support for writing lightmaps using irradiancemeter sensor type
- need workflow design

replace xml writing with etree

Location to copy .mod and .xml files
- Is there a better place, i.e. in /Users/Shared/Autodesk/.... ?

Notes on usage
- Energyredistributionpathtracing, maxChains is noted as a float attribute in the documentation but the implementation expects an integer
- Energyredistributionpathtracing seems to render, with continuous "Unable to recreate specular vertex in perturbation" errors
- Progressive Photon Map crashes
- The roughdiffuse bsdf alpha parameter is described as a 'spectrum or texture' but plugin expects a float
- What material does the 'Bk7' IOR correspond to?
- Kajia-Kay phase function produces NaNs when used with the HK surface shader
